        <h2>How We Met</h2>
        <p>Our story began in JS1 at Sky Brain Secondary School, where two young students crossed paths. From the moment we met, there was an undeniable connection. What started as a simple friendship grew into something special—a bond built on laughter, shared moments, and countless conversations.</p>
        <p>Little did I know then, those early moments of friendship would lay the foundation for something far greater—something that would continue to grow stronger with each passing day.</p>

        <h2>About Her</h2>
        <p>Her name is Peace, a beautiful young girl whose kindness and selflessness have always stood out. From the very beginning, Peace has been a source of support and care. Whenever I wasn’t in school, she would go out of her way to ensure I didn’t fall behind, copying all my notes and making sure I stayed on track.</p>
        <p>Her pure intentions and thoughtful actions speak volumes about the incredible person she is. She’s not just beautiful on the outside, but her heart shines even brighter, making her truly one of a kind.</p>

        <h2>Special Moments</h2>
        <p>There’s one moment that stands out to me, a moment that made me realize I was falling for Peace. One day, I couldn’t make it to school, and I gave her my locker key to help me out. When I returned the next day, I was amazed. Not only had she copied all my notes, but her writing was so exceptional and beautiful—it was clear how much care and effort she put into it.</p>
        <p>That simple act of kindness, done with such grace and thoughtfulness, touched me deeply. It was in that moment I knew I had found someone truly special. Her attention to detail, her willingness to help without asking for anything in return, made me see her in a new light. It was more than just about the notes—it was about her heart, her character, and how she made everything feel more meaningful.</p>

        <h2>What She Means to Me</h2>
        <p>Peace is more than just a friend; she’s a part of my heart, my source of joy, and the one who makes every day brighter. Her kindness, her thoughtfulness, and her unwavering support have made my life better in ways words can’t fully capture.</p>
        <p>She’s the person I turn to when I need guidance, when I need a friend, and when I just need someone who understands. The way she cares for others—especially me—reminds me daily of how blessed I am to know her.</p>
        <p>In her, I’ve found someone who inspires me to be better, to appreciate the little things, and to always strive for kindness. She means the world to me, and I can’t imagine a future without her by my side.</p>

        <h2>Our Time Together</h2>
        <p>After we finished secondary school, we took a step forward and began a relationship. It was a brief 24 hours, but in that time, we shared a connection that was genuine and full of promise. Though our paths eventually diverged, that time together will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, even the shortest moments can have the greatest impact, and I’ll forever cherish the memories we created. Life has a way of teaching us valuable lessons, and I’m grateful for everything we shared, no matter how brief.</p>
